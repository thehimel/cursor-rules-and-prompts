## Copyright Protection

**CRITICAL**: Do not include any copyrighted course content, proprietary materials, or specific examples from copyrighted sources. When converting transcripts:

* Extract and transform only the **conceptual information** and **technical knowledge**
* Avoid copying specific examples, code snippets, or content that may be copyrighted
* Focus on **generic explanations** and **conceptual understanding** rather than verbatim course materials
* If examples are necessary, use generic, non-copyrighted alternatives
* Do not reproduce copyrighted slide content, course-specific examples, or proprietary materials
