description: Rules for organizing Electron projects with clear separation between foundational/template code and application-specific code. Template code goes in src/, app-specific code goes in src/app/.

# Electron Project Organization

## Core Principle

Separate foundational/template code from application-specific code:

- **Foundational/Template Code** → `src/` - Reusable across Electron projects
- **Application-Specific Code** → `src/app/` - Specific to this application

## Directory Structure

### Foundational Utilities (`src/utils/`)

Generic utilities reusable across projects:

- Platform-specific utilities (icon paths, file system helpers)
- Framework configuration (logging, protocol handlers)
- System integration (tray, window management, auto-updater)
- Generic helpers that work across different applications

These utilities have no dependencies on application-specific code and can be extracted for use in other projects.

### Application Utilities (`src/app/utils/`)

Application-specific utilities:

- Feature-specific storage and data management
- Application-specific file operations
- Business logic specific to the application domain
- Domain-specific helpers and validators

These utilities depend on application-specific types, data structures, or business logic.

### Foundational Components (`src/components/`)

Global library components and shared UI:

- Component library components
- Theme providers and utilities
- Generic UI components
- App wrapper components

These components are reusable and not tied to specific application features.

### Application Components (`src/app/components/`)

Application-specific components:

- Feature-specific layouts
- Domain-specific components
- Application-specific icons and assets
- Business logic components

These components implement application-specific functionality and UI.

## Rules

### ✅ DO

- Place reusable Electron utilities in `src/utils/`
- Place application-specific utilities in `src/app/utils/`
- Place library/shared components in `src/components/`
- Place application-specific components in `src/app/components/`
- Keep foundational code independent of application code
- Make foundational utilities importable by application code

### ❌ DON'T

- Mix foundational and application-specific code
- Place application-specific logic in foundational utilities
- Place reusable utilities in application directories
- Create dependencies from foundational code to application code
- Include application-specific types or data in foundational code

## Benefits

- **Reusability**: Foundational code can be extracted for other projects
- **Clear boundaries**: Easy to identify what's template vs application-specific
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation makes code easier to understand and modify
- **Template-friendly**: Foundation code serves as a reusable template
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new features without affecting foundational code
