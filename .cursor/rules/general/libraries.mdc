# Libraries & Dependencies

## Library Selection
- Use popular, well-maintained libraries over custom code
- Choose the best/most popular library for each specific purpose
- Minimal custom implementation - utilize community solutions
- Research and use battle-tested solutions

## Before Writing Custom Code
1. Check if a popular library exists
2. Verify it's actively maintained
3. Confirm it's the best solution for the purpose
4. Only write custom code if no suitable library exists

## Examples
- Authentication → use established auth libraries
- Form validation → use popular validation libraries
- State management → use proven state libraries
- API clients → use well-known HTTP clients
