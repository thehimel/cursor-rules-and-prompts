description: Rules for organizing feature code in single directories. All feature-related code (types, hooks, components, utils) must be grouped together in one feature directory.

# Feature Organization

## Core Principle

When implementing a feature, ALL related code must be in ONE directory:

```
src/components/feature-name/
├── types.ts              # All TypeScript interfaces for this feature
├── hooks/
│   ├── useFeature.ts     # Custom hooks
│   └── useFeatureState.ts
├── components/
│   ├── FeatureComponent.tsx
│   └── FeatureWrapper.tsx
├── utils/
│   ├── featureHelpers.ts
│   └── featureConstants.ts
├── data/
│   └── featureData.json  # If feature has its own data files
└── index.ts              # Public API exports

src/pages/
└── feature-name/         # Feature-specific pages
    ├── index.mdx
    └── settings.mdx
```

## Rules

### ✅ DO
- Keep all feature code in one directory
- Include types, hooks, components, utilities together
- Use `index.ts` for clean public exports
- Group by functionality within the feature directory

### ❌ DON'T
- Split feature code across multiple locations
- Mix feature components with general components
- Create separate directories for types/hooks/components of the same feature

## Example: Quiz Feature

```
src/components/quiz/          # ✅ All quiz code here
├── types.ts                  # Quiz interfaces
├── hooks/
│   └── useQuizSession.ts
├── components/
│   ├── QuizDialog.tsx
│   └── QuizView.tsx
└── index.ts

src/pages/lessons/a1/quizzes/ # ✅ Quiz pages
└── index.mdx

data/quizzes/                  # ✅ Quiz data
├── a1/
│   └── alphabets.json
└── meta.json
```

## Benefits

- **Easy to find**: All feature code in one place
- **Easy to remove**: Delete one directory to remove entire feature
- **Easy to maintain**: Clear boundaries between features
- **Better for team collaboration**: Clear ownership and structure
