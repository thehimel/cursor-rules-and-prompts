# Proper Use of Articles in Comments

All comments must include appropriate articles ('a', 'an', 'the') where necessary to maintain grammatical correctness and readability.

## Rules

1. Use "the" when referring to a specific or previously mentioned item
2. Use "a" or "an" when introducing a new, non-specific item
3. Use "an" before words starting with a vowel sound
4. Do not omit articles where they are grammatically required

## Examples

### Correct Usage

- ✅ "Initialize the database connection."
- ✅ "Create an instance of the User class."
- ✅ "Add a new item to the list."
- ✅ "Build the command based on the platform."
- ✅ "Handle the Finder separately (macOS only)."
- ✅ "Get the icon path for the window."
- ✅ "Open the project in the specified IDE."

### Incorrect Usage

- ❌ "Initialize database connection." → "Initialize **the** database connection."
- ❌ "Create instance of User class." → "Create **an** instance of **the** User class."
- ❌ "Add new item to list." → "Add **a** new item to **the** list."
- ❌ "Build command based on platform." → "Build **the** command based on **the** platform."
- ❌ "Handle Finder separately." → "Handle **the** Finder separately."
- ❌ "Get icon path for window." → "Get **the** icon path for **the** window."
- ❌ "Open project in specified IDE." → "Open **the** project in **the** specified IDE."

## Exceptions

- Code examples or technical terms that are conventionally written without articles
- Variable names or function names in comments
- URLs or file paths
- Short imperative commands where articles would be awkward (e.g., "Save file" in UI labels)
