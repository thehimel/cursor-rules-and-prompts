# File Endings

## Core Principle

All files must end with **exactly one newline character** after the content. No additional trailing newlines should be present.

## Rules

1. Files must end with exactly one newline character (`\n`)
2. Do not add multiple newlines at the end of files
3. Do not omit the final newline character
4. The newline should be the last character in the file

## Examples

### ✅ Correct

**Code file:**
```
// File content here
const example = "value";

```

**Markdown file:**
```
# Documentation Title

This is the content.

```

**Config file:**
```
key1=value1
key2=value2

```

**Documentation file:**
```
This is documentation content.
More content here.

```

All files end with exactly one newline after the last line.

### ❌ Incorrect

**Multiple newlines:**
```
// File content here
const example = "value";


```

```
# Documentation Title

This is the content.


```

File ends with multiple newlines (2+).

### ❌ Incorrect

**No newline:**
```
// File content here
const example = "value";
```

```
# Documentation Title

This is the content.
```

File ends with no newline character.

## Implementation

When creating or editing files:
- Ensure the file ends with exactly one newline character
- Remove any extra trailing newlines
- Add a single newline if the file is missing the final newline

## Remember

- One newline at the end of every file
- No more, no less
- This applies to all file types (code, config, documentation, etc.)
