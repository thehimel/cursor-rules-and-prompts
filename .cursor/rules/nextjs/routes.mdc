# Routes & URLs

## Route Constants
- ALL URL routes MUST be defined as constants first
- Store route constants in `@/lib/routes.ts`
- NEVER hardcode URLs directly in components or API calls

## Pattern
```typescript
export const API_ROUTES = {
  CATEGORY: {
    ENDPOINT_NAME: '/api/category/endpoint',
  }
} as const;
```

## Usage
```typescript
// ✅ Good
import { API_ROUTES } from '@/lib/routes';
fetch(API_ROUTES.GOOGLE.DRIVE_PROXY);

// ❌ Bad
fetch('/api/google/drive-proxy');
```

## Rules
- Define route constant before using it
- Use descriptive, uppercase names
- Group by feature/category
- Use `as const` for type safety
