# Rule Creation

## Category Organization

- Fit new rules into existing categories when possible
- Only create new categories when necessary

## Required Frontmatter

```
---
id: rule-{category}-{filename-without-ext}
alwaysApply: true | false
description: concise description
author: Himel Das

```

**ID Format**: `rule-{category}-{filename-without-ext}`
- Example: `rule-general-file-organization` for `general/file-organization.mdc`
- Enables file tracking during sync operations

## Content Guidelines

- Keep rules and prompts concise
- Stay generic and language-independent
- Avoid project-specific details or confidential information
- Focus on what to do, not how to do it

## File Format

- Save rules as `.mdc` files with kebab-case names
