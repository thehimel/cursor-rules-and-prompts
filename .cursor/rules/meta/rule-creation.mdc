# Rule Creation

## Category Organization

- Each directory in the rules folder represents a category
- When creating a new rule, attempt to fit it into an existing category
- Only create a new category if the rule cannot fit into any existing category

## Required Frontmatter

All rule files must include these fields in order:

```
---
id: rule-{category}-{filename-without-ext}
alwaysApply: true | false
description: concise description

```

### ID Field

- **Required**: Every rule file must have a unique `id` field
- **Format**: `rule-{category}-{filename-without-ext}`
  - `{category}` is the directory name (e.g., `academic`, `general`, `meta`)
  - `{filename-without-ext}` is the filename without the `.mdc` extension
- **Examples**:
  - `rule-academic-copyright-and-genericity` (file: `academic/copyright-and-genericity.mdc`)
  - `rule-meta-rule-creation` (file: `meta/rule-creation.mdc`)
  - `rule-general-file-organization` (file: `general/file-organization.mdc`)
- **Purpose**: Enables ID-based file matching during sync operations, allowing files to be tracked even when renamed

## Content Guidelines

- Be concise and generic
- Remain project and programming language independent
- Avoid code snippets, examples, or project-specific information
- Do not include confidential or personal information
- Explain what to do, not how to do it
- Follow professional best practices for AI agent rules

## File Format

- Always save rules in `.mdc` files
- Use lowercase words separated by dashes for filenames
