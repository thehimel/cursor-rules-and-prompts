# Always Apply All Rules

## Core Principle

**Rules in the `.cursor/rules/` directory MUST be followed based on their `alwaysApply` setting:**
- Rules with `alwaysApply: true` MUST be followed in EVERY conversation and project
- Rules with `alwaysApply: false` should only be followed when relevant to the project context

## Rule Application

- Rules with `alwaysApply: true` in their frontmatter are automatically active in all conversations
- Rules with `alwaysApply: false` are applied only when relevant to the specific project context
- Rules are organized by category in subdirectories
- Each rule file contains specific guidelines that must be followed when applicable
- No rule should be ignored or bypassed unless explicitly overridden by a higher-priority rule

## Enforcement

- When implementing any feature or making any changes, verify compliance with ALL applicable rules
- Apply rules with `alwaysApply: true` unconditionally
- Apply rules with `alwaysApply: false` only when they match the project context (e.g., technology stack, project type, etc.)
- If rules conflict, prioritize more specific rules over general ones
- When in doubt, refer to the specific rule file for clarification
- Rules are cumulative - all applicable rules must be followed simultaneously

## Rule Discovery

- Check `.cursor/rules/` directory structure to find relevant rules
- Read rule files to understand specific requirements
- Rules are self-documenting with clear DO/DON'T patterns

## Priority

This meta-rule has the highest priority and ensures that:
- All rules with `alwaysApply: true` are discovered and applied in every conversation
- Rules with `alwaysApply: false` are applied when contextually relevant
- No rule is accidentally ignored when it should be active
- Consistent behavior across all projects and conversations
