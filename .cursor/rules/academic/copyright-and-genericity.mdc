# Copyright and Genericity Rule

## Core Principle

When creating rules and prompts, **never include examples, content, or specific details from course materials** as they are subject to copyright. Always use generic, original examples and content that can apply to any context.

## Guidelines

### What Not to Include

❌ **Never include:**
- Specific examples from course lectures or materials
- Course-specific terminology or concepts used in examples
- Quoted text from course resources
- References to specific course content or assignments
- Domain-specific examples that originate from copyrighted materials

### What to Do Instead

✅ **Always use:**
- Generic, domain-agnostic examples
- Original content created for the purpose of the rule/prompt
- Common knowledge examples (e.g., general programming concepts, standard workflows)
- Universal scenarios that apply broadly (e.g., user authentication, data processing pipelines)
- Examples from widely available public knowledge

### When Creating Rules or Prompts

- Write rules that are **context-independent** and applicable across domains
- Use placeholder-style examples (e.g., "application", "system", "component") rather than specific implementations
- Focus on **principles and patterns** rather than specific implementations from course materials
- If examples are needed, create generic ones that comprehensibly illustrate the principle

## Remember

- Course materials are copyrighted - even paraphrasing specific examples is risky
- Generic examples serve the purpose better as they're more broadly applicable
- Focus on teaching principles and patterns, not reproducing copyrighted content
- When in doubt, make it more generic and less specific
- Original examples are always better than borrowed ones
