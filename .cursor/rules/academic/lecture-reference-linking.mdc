# Lecture Reference Linking Rule

## Core Principle

When writing exam answers or documentation that references course materials, **always include both a course materials list at the top and inline references throughout the content**. This makes it clear which lectures support each part of your answer and helps readers verify sources.

## Course Materials List

**Always include a "Course Materials:" section at the top** of each answer file, listing all lectures used:

```markdown
Course Materials:

- [lecture-01](../lectures/lecture-01)
- [lecture-04](../lectures/lecture-04)
- [lecture-05](../lectures/lecture-05)
```

**Guidelines:**
- List **all lectures** that contain material used in the answers
- Use relative paths: `[lecture-XX](../lectures/lecture-XX)`
- Order lectures by number (lecture-01, lecture-02, etc.)
- Include the full list even if you only reference one lecture in a specific section

## Inline References

**Add inline references throughout your answers** wherever you draw from course materials:

**Format:**
- Use abbreviated format: `[L1](../lectures/lecture-01)`, `[L4](../lectures/lecture-04)`, etc.
- Place references at natural break points: after definitions, examples, or key concepts
- Multiple references can be combined: `([L1](../lectures/lecture-01), [L4](../lectures/lecture-04))`

**When to add references:**

✅ **Always reference when:**
- Stating a definition from a lecture
- Using examples directly from course materials
- Explaining concepts introduced in specific lectures
- Quoting or paraphrasing course content
- Referencing specific patterns, queries, or techniques taught

✅ **Reference placement examples:**
- After definitions: "**Concept X** is defined as... ([L4](../lectures/lecture-04))"
- After examples: "The system example ([L4](../lectures/lecture-04), [L5](../lectures/lecture-05)) demonstrates..."
- After code/queries: "```sql SELECT ... ``` ([L6](../lectures/lecture-06))"
- After key concepts: "The key advantage is **principle Y** ([L4](../lectures/lecture-04))"

❌ **Don't reference:**
- Generic knowledge that's common across multiple sources
- Your own explanations or analogies (unless they're directly based on a lecture)
- General examples you create yourself

## Reference Style Guidelines

### Abbreviated Format

Use **short abbreviations** for inline references to keep text readable:
- `[L1](../lectures/lecture-01)` instead of `[lecture-01](../lectures/lecture-01)`
- `[L4](../lectures/lecture-04)` instead of `[lecture-04](../lectures/lecture-04)`

### Placement

Place references **naturally in the flow**:
- At the end of sentences introducing concepts
- After definitions or key terms
- After examples or code blocks
- Before or after quoted material

**Good placement:**
```
**Concept X** is defined as a method that performs operations on data ([L4](../lectures/lecture-04)). 
It works by processing information in a structured way...
```

**Avoid:**
- Breaking up sentences awkwardly just to add a reference
- Putting references in the middle of definitions
- Over-referencing the same concept multiple times in one paragraph

### Multiple References

When referencing multiple lectures:
- Combine them: `([L1](../lectures/lecture-01), [L4](../lectures/lecture-04))`
- Use when concepts span multiple lectures
- Place at the most relevant point in the text

## Examples

### ✅ Correct Structure

```markdown
# Topic Title

Course Materials:

- [lecture-01](../lectures/lecture-01)
- [lecture-04](../lectures/lecture-04)
- [lecture-05](../lectures/lecture-05)

## What is Concept X?

**Concept X** is defined as a method that performs operations on data ([L4](../lectures/lecture-04)). 
It works by processing information in a structured way.

Think about the progression from **data** → **information** → **processed data** → **result** ([L1](../lectures/lecture-01), [L4](../lectures/lecture-04)):

- **Data** is raw representation...
```

### ✅ Reference After Examples

```markdown
**Pattern:** Detect when a specific condition occurs within a time window ([L6](../lectures/lecture-06)):

```sql
PATTERN SEQ(EventA+ a[], EventB b)
WHERE condition
WITHIN time_window
```
```

### ✅ Reference for Specific Concepts

```markdown
The key advantage is **decoupling** ([L4](../lectures/lecture-04)) - components don't need to know what other components will do with the data.
```

### ❌ Missing Course Materials List

```markdown
# Topic Title

## What is Concept X?

**Concept X** is defined as a method...
```

### ❌ No Inline References

```markdown
Course Materials:

- [lecture-04](../lectures/lecture-04)

## What is Concept X?

**Concept X** is defined as a method that performs operations on data. 
It works by processing information...
```

## Checklist

When writing exam answers with lecture references:

✅ Course Materials section at the top with all used lectures
✅ Inline references after definitions from lectures
✅ Inline references after examples from course materials
✅ Inline references for specific patterns, queries, or techniques
✅ Abbreviated format ([L1], [L4]) for readability
✅ Natural placement that doesn't disrupt flow
✅ Multiple references combined when appropriate

## Remember

- **Always include both**: Course materials list at top AND inline references throughout
- **Be consistent**: Use the same abbreviated format ([L1], [L4]) throughout
- **Reference appropriately**: Don't over-reference, but don't miss important citations
- **Keep it readable**: References should enhance clarity, not clutter the text
- **Link to actual lectures**: Make sure paths are correct and lectures exist
- **Complete coverage**: If you use material from a lecture, include it in both the list and inline references
