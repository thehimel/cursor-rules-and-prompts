# Short Answer Version Rule

## Core Principle

When creating short versions of detailed answers, create a **super concise version** that is short and easy to study quickly, while remaining **fully understandable** when read independently. This version provides a condensed format for quick review and study.

## File Naming

**Format:** Add `-short` suffix to the detailed version filename

- If detailed version is `README.md` → short version is `README-short.md`
- If detailed version is `detailed-answers.md` → short version is `detailed-answers-short.md`
- Place in the same directory as the detailed version
- Use the same directory structure as detailed answers
- Keep the same file organization

## Content Requirements

### Length and Conciseness

**Target:** Reduce content significantly (typically 50-70% reduction) while maintaining:
- **Complete understanding** - someone reading only this version should understand the full picture
- **Key concepts** - all essential definitions and explanations
- **Critical examples** - simplified but meaningful real-world examples
- **Important distinctions** - key differences and comparisons

### Structure

**Maintain the same structure as detailed version:**
- Course Materials list at top
- Same question headers (with importance stars and tick marks preserved)
- Same diagram references (use ALL diagrams from detailed version)
- Horizontal rules after each answer section

**Content organization:**
- Use paragraphs when needed for clarity
- Use bullet points for lists and comparisons
- Use tables for side-by-side comparisons (simplified)
- Keep essential examples but make them more concise

### Diagram Usage

**CRITICAL:** Use **ALL the same figures/diagrams** from the detailed version:
- Reference the exact same diagram files
- Do NOT create any new figures for the concise version
- Maintain all diagram references in the same positions
- Diagrams help understanding even in concise format

### Formatting Guidelines

**Bold important points:**
- **Key terms and concepts** when first introduced
- **Critical distinctions** and differences
- **Main characteristics** of systems, approaches, or methods
- **Core principles** and definitions

**Use emphasis strategically:**
- Bold for definitions and key concepts
- Italic for emphasis on specific aspects
- Keep formatting consistent with detailed version style

### Content Selection

**What to include:**
- ✅ Core definitions and explanations
- ✅ Key characteristics and features
- ✅ Essential differences and comparisons
- ✅ Simplified but meaningful examples
- ✅ Critical concepts and principles
- ✅ Important trade-offs and considerations

**What to condense or remove:**
- ❌ Extended explanations and elaborations
- ❌ Multiple similar examples (keep one best example)
- ❌ Detailed step-by-step processes (summarize)
- ❌ Extensive background information
- ❌ Repetitive explanations
- ❌ Overly detailed sub-sections

### Writing Style

**Maintain academic standards:**
- Follow all rules from `exam-answer-format.mdc`
- Include course materials list
- Include inline references to lectures
- Use neutral language (no "you")
- Maintain conversational but professional tone

**Conciseness techniques:**
- Combine related points into single sentences
- Use parallel structure for comparisons
- Eliminate redundant phrases
- Focus on essential information
- Use clear, direct language

### Example Transformation

**Detailed version:**
```
An event is something that happened in a system. In computing, it's also the programming entity that represents that occurrence. Events are data with context - specifically, they're what you get when you take raw data and add meaning plus timing information about when and where it occurred.

Think of the progression from data → information → event like this: raw data is just numbers or symbols. Add semantics and it becomes information. Add context like timestamps and location, and it becomes an event.
```

**Concise version:**
```
An **event** is something that happened in a system - it's **data with context** (semantics + timing information).

**Progression:** **Data** → **Information** → **Event**
```

## Quality Checklist

When creating concise versions, ensure:

✅ Content reduced by 50-70% while maintaining understanding
✅ All key concepts and definitions included
✅ All diagrams from detailed version referenced
✅ Important points are bolded
✅ Course materials and inline references included
✅ Horizontal rules after each answer section
✅ Question headers with stars and tick marks preserved
✅ Can be understood independently without detailed version
✅ Suitable for quick study and exam preparation
✅ Follows all academic formatting rules

## Remember

- **Concise but complete** - short enough for quick study, complete enough for understanding
- **Same diagrams** - use all figures from detailed version, no new ones
- **Bold key points** - make important concepts stand out
- **Maintain structure** - keep same organization as detailed version
- **Short format** - optimized for quick review and study
