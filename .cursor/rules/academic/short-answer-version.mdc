# Short Answer Version Rule

## Core Principle

When creating short versions of detailed answers, create a **super concise version** that is short and easy to study quickly, while remaining **fully understandable** when read independently. This version provides a condensed format for quick review and study.

## File Naming

**Format:** Add `-short` suffix to the detailed version filename

- If detailed version is `README.md` → short version is `README-short.md`
- If detailed version is `detailed-answers.md` → short version is `detailed-answers-short.md`
- Place in the same directory as the detailed version
- Use the same directory structure as detailed answers
- Keep the same file organization

## Content Requirements

### Length and Conciseness

**Target:** Reduce content significantly (typically 50-70% reduction) while maintaining:
- **Complete understanding** - someone reading only this version should understand the full picture
- **Key concepts** - all essential definitions and explanations
- **Critical examples** - simplified but meaningful real-world examples
- **Important distinctions** - key differences and comparisons

### Structure

**Maintain the same structure as detailed version:**
- Same header structure and organization
- Same question headers (with any importance markers preserved)
- Same diagram references (use ALL diagrams from detailed version)
- Same section separators (horizontal rules, etc.)

**Navigation Links:**
- **CRITICAL:** Add a navigation link at the beginning of each answer section (right after the question header)
- **Format:** `[📖 View detailed answer](./detailed-filename.md#anchor-name)` where `detailed-filename.md` is the name of the detailed version file
- **Anchor format:** Convert header text to anchor by:
  - Converting to lowercase
  - Replacing spaces with hyphens
  - Removing special characters (?, ✓, etc.)
  - **IMPORTANT:** If special characters are removed from the end of the header, add a trailing hyphen to the anchor
- **Example:** If detailed version is `README.md` and header is "What is a concept? ✓✓", link becomes `[📖 View detailed answer](./README.md#what-is-a-concept-)` (note the trailing hyphen after removing ✓✓)
- **Purpose:** Allows easy navigation from short version to corresponding detailed section

**Content organization:**
- Use paragraphs when needed for clarity
- Use bullet points for lists and comparisons
- Use tables for side-by-side comparisons (simplified)
- Keep essential examples but make them more concise

### Diagram Usage

**CRITICAL:** Use **ALL the same figures/diagrams** from the detailed version:
- Reference the exact same diagram files
- Do NOT create any new figures for the concise version
- Maintain all diagram references in the same positions
- Diagrams help understanding even in concise format

### Formatting Guidelines

**Bold important points:**
- **Key terms and concepts** when first introduced
- **Critical distinctions** and differences
- **Main characteristics** of systems, approaches, or methods
- **Core principles** and definitions

**Use emphasis strategically:**
- Bold for definitions and key concepts
- Italic for emphasis on specific aspects
- Keep formatting consistent with detailed version style

### Content Selection

**What to include:**
- ✅ Core definitions and explanations
- ✅ Key characteristics and features
- ✅ Essential differences and comparisons
- ✅ Simplified but meaningful examples
- ✅ Critical concepts and principles
- ✅ Important trade-offs and considerations

**What to condense or remove:**
- ❌ Extended explanations and elaborations
- ❌ Multiple similar examples (keep one best example)
- ❌ Detailed step-by-step processes (summarize)
- ❌ Extensive background information
- ❌ Repetitive explanations
- ❌ Overly detailed sub-sections

### Writing Style

**Maintain academic standards:**
- Follow all applicable academic formatting rules
- Include source materials list if required by academic standards
- Include inline references to sources if required
- Use neutral language (no "you")
- Maintain conversational but professional tone

**Conciseness techniques:**
- Combine related points into single sentences
- Use parallel structure for comparisons
- Eliminate redundant phrases
- Focus on essential information
- Use clear, direct language

### Example Transformation

**Detailed version:**
```
A concept is a fundamental idea or principle in a domain. In computing, it's also the abstract representation that models real-world phenomena. Concepts are structured knowledge - specifically, they're what you get when you take raw information and add meaning plus relationships about how elements connect and interact.

Think of the progression from data → information → concept like this: raw data is just numbers or symbols. Add semantics and it becomes information. Add relationships and structure, and it becomes a concept.
```

**Concise version:**
```
A **concept** is a fundamental idea in a domain - it's **structured knowledge** (semantics + relationships).

**Progression:** **Data** → **Information** → **Concept**
```

## Quality Checklist

When creating concise versions, ensure:

✅ Content reduced by 50-70% while maintaining understanding
✅ All key concepts and definitions included
✅ All diagrams from detailed version referenced
✅ Important points are bolded
✅ Source materials and inline references included (if required)
✅ Section separators maintained
✅ Question headers with any markers preserved
✅ Navigation links added at beginning of each answer section (link to detailed version filename)
✅ Can be understood independently without detailed version
✅ Suitable for quick study and preparation
✅ Follows all applicable formatting rules

## Remember

- **Concise but complete** - short enough for quick study, complete enough for understanding
- **Same diagrams** - use all figures from detailed version, no new ones
- **Bold key points** - make important concepts stand out
- **Maintain structure** - keep same organization as detailed version
- **Navigation links** - add link to detailed version at start of each answer
- **Short format** - optimized for quick review and study
