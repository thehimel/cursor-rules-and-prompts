# Documentation

## File Structure
- When creating multiple md files for a feature, create a dedicated directory in `docs/`
- Each feature directory MUST have a `README.md` file

## File Naming
- Use lowercase words separated by dashes
- Format: `file-name.md`

## Examples
```
docs/
  feature-name/
    README.md
    setup-guide.md
    troubleshooting.md
```

## Rules
- ✅ Group related docs in feature directories
- ✅ Always include README.md in feature directories
- ✅ Use kebab-case for all md filenames
- ❌ Don't use spaces or underscores in filenames
- ❌ Don't use uppercase letters in filenames

## Comments in Code
- ✅ Use neutral, descriptive language
- ✅ Focus on WHAT and WHY, not ownership
- ❌ Don't use possessive pronouns like "your", "your project", "yours"
- ❌ Don't use template-style placeholder language

### Examples
- ✅ Good: `// 1200x630 image in public folder`
- ❌ Bad: `// Your 1200x630 image in public folder`

## File Linking in Documentation
- ✅ Always use markdown links when referencing files
- ✅ Use relative paths from the current file location
- ✅ Format: `[File Name](./relative/path/to/file.ext)]`
- ✅ Make links descriptive and clickable
- ❌ Don't use plain text file references without links
- ❌ Don't use absolute paths in markdown files

### Examples
- ✅ Good: `See [schema.json](./schema.json) for full type definitions`
- ✅ Good: `Example in [alphabets.json](./a1/alphabets.json)`
- ❌ Bad: `See schema.json` or `See "schema.json"`
- ❌ Bad: `See /Users/admin/project/file.json`

## Code in Documentation
- ✅ Link to actual implemented files instead of duplicating code
- ✅ Use file references when code already exists in the codebase
- ✅ Remove large code blocks and replace with links
- ✅ Keep only concise snippets or pseudocode for explanation
- ❌ Don't duplicate entire implementations from files
- ❌ Don't copy large code blocks that are already in the codebase

### Examples
- ✅ Good: `See: [quiz-session.ts](./quiz-session.ts)`
- ✅ Good: `Link to: [types.ts](/src/components/quiz/types.ts)`
- ❌ Bad: Copying 200 lines of code that already exist in a file
