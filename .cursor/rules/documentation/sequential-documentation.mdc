# Sequential Documentation

When implementing a new feature and creating documentation for it, follow these rules to determine where to place the documentation and whether to use sequential numbering.

## Decision Tree

### 1. Check for `docs/steps/` Directory

**If `docs/steps/` exists:**
- Proceed to check for sequential numbering pattern

**If `docs/steps/` does NOT exist:**
- Place documentation directly in `docs/` directory
- Do NOT use sequential numbering

### 2. Check for Sequential Numbering Pattern

**If `docs/steps/` exists AND contains files with sequential numbers (e.g., `1-feature.md`, `2-feature.md`):**
- Add new documentation with the next sequential number
- Format: `N-feature-name.md` where N is the next number in sequence
- Place in `docs/steps/` directory

**If `docs/steps/` exists BUT does NOT contain sequentially numbered files:**
- Add documentation in `docs/steps/` directory
- Do NOT add sequential numbering
- Use standard kebab-case naming: `feature-name.md`

## Examples

### Scenario 1: Sequential Documentation Exists

```
docs/
  steps/
    1-initialization.md
    2-menu-bar-icon.md
    3-command-execution.md
```

**Action:** Add new feature doc as `4-new-feature.md` in `docs/steps/`

### Scenario 2: Steps Folder Exists, No Sequential Pattern

```
docs/
  steps/
    setup-guide.md
    troubleshooting.md
    configuration.md
```

**Action:** Add new feature doc as `new-feature.md` in `docs/steps/`

### Scenario 3: No Steps Folder

```
docs/
  README.md
  setup.md
  api-guide.md
```

**Action:** Add new feature doc as `new-feature.md` directly in `docs/`

## Rules

- ✅ Always check for `docs/steps/` directory first
- ✅ Look for existing sequential numbering pattern
- ✅ Match the existing documentation structure
- ✅ Use kebab-case for all documentation filenames
- ❌ Don't create sequential numbering if it doesn't already exist
- ❌ Don't mix sequential and non-sequential docs in the same directory
- ❌ Don't skip numbers in the sequence

## Sequential Numbering Format

When using sequential numbering:
- Format: `N-feature-name.md`
- N is an integer starting from 1
- Use single dash between number and name
- Use kebab-case for the feature name portion
- Examples: `1-setup.md`, `2-authentication.md`, `10-deployment.md`

## When to Create Sequential Documentation

Sequential documentation is useful for:
- Implementation steps that build on each other
- Feature development timeline
- Tutorial or guide progression
- Migration or upgrade steps

Sequential documentation may NOT be appropriate for:
- Reference documentation
- Independent feature docs
- API documentation
- General guides
