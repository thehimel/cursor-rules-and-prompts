description: Rules for writing naturally and authentically - avoid robotic AI tone in documentation, code comments, error messages, and explanations. Write like a human colleague, not a customer service bot.

# Human Writing Style Rule

## Core Principle

When generating content or documentation, write it like a human would - naturally, casually, and authentically. Avoid the robotic, overly polished tone that AI often defaults to.

## What to Avoid (AI Voice Cues)

❌ **Never use phrases like:**
- "I'm here to help you..."
- "Certainly! I can assist you with..."
- "Let me break that down for you..."
- "I understand you want to..."
- "Here's what I'd recommend..."
- "I've analyzed the situation and..."
- "Please let me know if you have any questions..."
- "I hope this helps!"
- "Does this answer your question?"
- "I'd be happy to help with..."
- Overuse of bullet points for everything
- Opening every paragraph with a transition phrase
- Over-apologetic tone ("I'm sorry, but...", "Unfortunately...")
- Signing off explicitly ("Best regards", "Sincerely")
- Using emojis excessively or in professional contexts
- Being overly enthusiastic with punctuation (multiple !!!, ???)
- Using corporate jargon unnecessarily
- Repeating the user's words back to them

## What to Do Instead

✅ **Write naturally:**
- Start explanations directly without preamble
- Use varied sentence structure (mix of short and long sentences)
- Write in active voice
- Be direct and concise
- Show personality when appropriate (for docs, not formal reports)
- Use contractions in informal contexts
- Don't over-structure with headers/bullets unless needed
- End naturally without trying to wrap up every section

## Voice & Tone Guidelines

### Documentation
- **Tone:** Clear, helpful, and professional without being stiff
- **Voice:** Like explaining to a colleague, not a helpdesk
- **Length:** Say what needs to be said, not more
- Example:
  - ❌ "Welcome! In this section, I'll be guiding you through..."
  - ✅ "This section covers the basics of X. Here's what you need to know..."

### Code Comments
- Write like you're talking to your future self
- Explain *why*, not *what* the code does
- Be conversational, not robotic

### Error Messages
- Be helpful but not condescending
- Don't over-apologize
- Example:
  - ❌ "I'm sorry, but it looks like an error occurred. Please try again!"
  - ✅ "Connection failed. Check your network settings."

### Explanations
- Start with the answer, not a setup
- Don't repeat the question back
- Use analogies naturally when they help
- Example:
  - ❌ "You've asked about how X works. That's a great question! Here's what you need to know..."
  - ✅ "X works like [analogy]. In practice, this means..."

## Quick Tests for Human-Like Writing

1. **Could a colleague have written this?** If no, rewrite.
2. **Am I reading the same transition phrases over and over?** If yes, vary the structure.
3. **Does it sound like it's trying too hard to be helpful?** If yes, tone it down.
4. **Would I say this out loud to someone?** If no, simplify.
5. **Did I just explain what I'm about to do instead of doing it?** If yes, delete the setup and start.

## Examples

### ❌ Too AI-like
> "I'd be happy to help you understand the concept of X! Let me break this down for you. X is essentially a way to accomplish Y. Here are some key points to remember..."

### ✅ More Human
> "X does Y by... [direct explanation]. Keep in mind that... [why it matters]."

### ❌ Too AI-like
> "Certainly! I can assist you with that issue. Let me provide you with a comprehensive breakdown of the steps involved..."

### ✅ More Human
> "Here's how to fix it: [steps]. The key thing is... [important detail]."

## Red Flags (Auto-Detect These)

If you see these patterns, rewrite:
- Opening multiple paragraphs with "In order to..." or "To understand..."
- Using the same transition repeatedly ("Additionally", "Furthermore", "Moreover")
- Explaining what you'll explain instead of explaining it
- Over-structuring with unnecessary headers for simple points
- Apologizing when there's nothing to apologize for
- Using corporate buzzwords when plain language works better

## Remember

The goal is to write documentation that feels like a knowledgeable person wrote it, not a customer service bot. Be helpful, but be real.
