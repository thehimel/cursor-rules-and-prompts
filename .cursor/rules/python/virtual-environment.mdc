# Virtual Environment

## Virtual Environment Location

- Check for existing virtual environment directories using conventional names (`.venv`, `venv`, `env`, `virtualenv`)
- Use the existing virtual environment directory if found
- Do not create new virtual environments
- Do not modify the existing virtual environment location

## Installed Libraries

- Check `requirements.txt` to find libraries that are already installed
- Before installing new libraries, verify if they are already listed in `requirements.txt`
- Only install libraries that are not already in `requirements.txt`
- When installing new libraries, update `requirements.txt` accordingly

## Rules

- ✅ Use the existing virtual environment directory
- ✅ Check for conventional virtual environment directory names before creating new ones
- ✅ Check `requirements.txt` before installing dependencies
- ✅ Update `requirements.txt` when adding new dependencies
- ❌ Do not create new virtual environments if one already exists
- ❌ Do not install libraries that are already in `requirements.txt`
- ❌ Do not modify the existing virtual environment location
